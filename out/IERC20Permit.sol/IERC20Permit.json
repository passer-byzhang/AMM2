Adds the {permit} method, which can be used to change an account's ERC-20 allowance (see {IERC20-allowance}) by presenting a message signed by the account. By not relying on {IERC20-approve}, the token holder account doesn't need to send a transaction, and thus is not required to hold Ether at all. ==== Security Considerations There are two important considerations concerning the use of `permit`. The first is that a valid permit signature expresses an allowance, and it should not be assumed to convey additional meaning. In particular, it should not be considered as an intention to spend the allowance in any specific way. The second is that because permits have built-in replay protection and can be submitted by anyone, they can be frontrun. A protocol that uses permits should take this into consideration and allow a `permit` call to fail. Combining these two aspects, a pattern that may be generally recommended is: ```solidity function doThingWithPermit(..., uint256 value, uint256 deadline, uint8 v, bytes32 r, bytes32 s) public {     try token.permit(msg.sender, address(this), value, deadline, v, r, s) {} catch {}     doThing(..., value); } function doThing(..., uint256 value) public {     token.safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), value);     ... } ``` Observe that: 1) `msg.sender` is used as the owner, leaving no ambiguity as to the signer intent, and 2) the use of `try/catch` allows the permit to fail and makes the code tolerant to frontrunning. (See also {SafeERC20-safeTransferFrom}). Additionally, note that smart contract wallets (such as Argent or Safe) are not able to produce permit signatures, so contracts should have entry points that don't rely on permit.\",\"kind\":\"dev\",\"methods\":{\"DOMAIN_SEPARATOR()\":{\"details\":\"Returns the domain separator used in the encoding of the signature for {permit}, as defined by {EIP712}.\"},\"nonces(address)\":{\"details\":\"Returns the current nonce for `owner`.
